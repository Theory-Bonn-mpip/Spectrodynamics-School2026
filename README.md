## Announcement

We are delighted to announce that **SpectroDynamics 2026: Connecting Computational Spectroscopic Methods Across the Electromagnetic Spectrum** will take place at **CECAM, Lausanne**, from **7 – 11 September 2026**.

The school is supported by funding from **CECAM**, **Psi-k**, and **J. Chem. Phys.** which allows us to host an intensive, in-person training event focused on computational spectroscopy across frequency regimes and methodological frameworks.

Further details about the program, lecturers, and timetable can be found on the [**CECAM website**](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/spectrodynamics-2026-connecting-computational-spectroscopic-methods-across-the-electromagnetic-spectrum-1489).

## Applications and Selection Criteria

Participation in the school is **application-based**, and selection will be made to ensure a strong match between the program and the participants’ backgrounds and interests.

Please submit your application exclusively through the [**CECAM website**](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/spectrodynamics-2026-connecting-computational-spectroscopic-methods-across-the-electromagnetic-spectrum-1489)., via the “Participate” tab associated with this school.

A **strong application** should clearly demonstrate (in not more than 400 words):

- your current research interests and how they relate to quantum dynamics and/or computational spectroscopy;
- your motivation for attending the school, including which aspects of the program (lectures, tutorials, methods) are most relevant to your work;
- your background and level of experience (e.g. quantum dynamics, molecular dynamics, electronic structure methods, spectroscopy);
- **how you plan to use the techniques learned at the school in your ongoing or future research projects.**

Applicants are strongly encouraged to be **specific and concrete**, rather than generic. Applications that clearly articulate how the school will contribute to the applicant’s scientific development will be ranked most highly.

## Fellowships and Financial Support

Thanks to CECAM and Psi-k support, a **limited number of fellowships** will be available to help cover participation costs for selected applicants
who may face financial or structural barriers to attending.

When applying, please explicitly indicate in the “Your message” field whether you are requesting financial support, and specify **which type of support you need**:

- accommodation,
- travel, or
- **both accommodation and travel**.

Applicants who require support but do not clearly state this in their application will not be considered for fellowships.

## Contact and Updates

Updates, application links, and practical information will be posted in this repository and on the CECAM website.

We look forward to welcoming you to Lausanne for an intensive and interactive week of learning and scientific exchange.
