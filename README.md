## Announcement

We are delighted to announce that **SpectroDynamics 2026: Connecting Computational Spectroscopic Methods Across the Electromagnetic Spectrum** will take place at **CECAM, Lausanne**, from **31 August – 4 September 2026**.

The school is supported by funding from **CECAM**, which allows us to host an intensive, in-person training event focused on computational spectroscopy across frequency regimes and methodological frameworks.

Further details about the program, lecturers, and timetable can be found on the **CECAM website** (link to be added).

## School Format and Philosophy

Over the past years, a wide range of high-quality lecture material on computational spectroscopy has become freely available online. While these resources are extremely valuable, they cannot fully replace **direct interaction, hands-on problem solving, and in-depth scientific discussion**.

For this reason, the SpectroDynamics school is designed not as a traditional conference or lecture-only event, but as a **cohesive training school** that combines:

- foundational and advanced lectures,
- **three extended hands-on tutorial sessions**, and
- ample time for discussion, interaction, and collaboration.

A key component of the school is the practical sessions, where participants will work closely with instructors, tutors, and fellow students to implement and apply computational spectroscopy methods. These sessions are intended to help participants **translate theoretical knowledge into tools they can use in their own research**.

## Applications and Selection Criteria

Participation in the school is **application-based**, and selection will be made to ensure a strong match between the program and the participants’ backgrounds and interests.

A **strong application** should clearly demonstrate:

- your current research interests and how they relate to quantum dynamics and/or computational spectroscopy;
- your motivation for attending the school, including which aspects of the program (lectures, tutorials, methods) are most relevant to your work;
- your background and level of experience (e.g. quantum dynamics, molecular dynamics, electronic structure methods, spectroscopy);
- how you plan to use the techniques learned at the school in your ongoing or future research projects.

Applicants are strongly encouraged to be **specific and concrete**, rather than generic. Applications that clearly articulate how the school will contribute to the applicant’s scientific development will be ranked most highly.

## Fellowships and Financial Support

Thanks to CECAM support, a **limited number of fellowships** will be available to help cover participation costs for selected applicants.

When applying, please **explicitly indicate** whether you are requesting financial support, and specify **which type of support you need**:

- accommodation,
- travel, or
- **both accommodation and travel**.

Fellowships will be allocated based on:

- the **scientific quality and motivation** of the application, and  
- the demonstrated **need for financial support**.

Applicants who require support but do not clearly state this in their application may not be considered for fellowships.

## Target Audience

The school is primarily aimed at:

- **PhD students**, and  
- **early-career postdoctoral researchers**

working in areas related to quantum dynamics, molecular simulations, and computational spectroscopy.

Advanced master’s students with a strong background and clear motivation may also be considered.

## Contact and Updates

Updates, application links, and practical information will be posted in this repository and on the CECAM website.

We look forward to welcoming you to Lausanne for an intensive and interactive week of learning and scientific exchange.
